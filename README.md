The compound specific isotope data explorer (CSIDE) is envisioned as a platform-independent isotopic data management tool that interfaces easily with different data formats from various types of instrumentation relevant to compound specific isotope analysis (e.g. GC-MS, GC-IRMS, GC-ICPMS) and provides data management, exploration and reporting tools that can combine and compare data from the different sources. This would allow easy integration of muliple types of compound specific information and easy discovery of long term trends and cross-data-set patterns. Modules that are planned to be integrated include the [isodat data processor](https://github.com/sebkopf/idp) for compound-specific H (and potentially C/N/O) isotope data, and the [DSQ data processor](https://github.com/sebkopf/dsqdp) for GC-MS data collected by Excalibur.

At the moment CSIDE is still very much a work in progress with only a bare bones GUI framework (pictured below) and no stable release yet (sorry).
